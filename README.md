- PHP: [Installation Guide](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)
- Composer: [Getting Started Guide](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository to your machine or server:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url-here
cd your-repository-directory
```

### Installing Dependencies

After cloning, install PHP dependencies with:

```bash
composer require google/apiclient:^2.0
```

For specific dependency versions, use the project's `composer.lock`:

```bash
composer install
```

To update dependencies:

```bash
composer update
```

**Note:** Commit your `composer.lock` to version control to synchronize dependency versions across environments.

### Configuring Google Client

Set up your Google Client:

1. Visit the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. Create or select a project.
3. Under "Credentials", create your project's credentials (e.g., OAuth 2.0 Client IDs).
4. Enable necessary APIs via the "Library" page. Specifically, add the Google Search Console API.
5. Configure your OAuth 2.0 Client ID credentials with appropriate domains and redirect URLs.

### API Scopes

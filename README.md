# PHP Google Search Console API Client

This script is designed to integrate Google services into a PHP-based web environment. It provides a seamless connection to Google APIs, facilitating data exchange and enhancing functionality. This solution is especially crafted for e-commerce and content management systems like PrestaShop and WordPress, but it's versatile enough to be utilized in any PHP environment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through the process of setting up the script in your PHP environment. Follow these steps to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have PHP and Composer installed on your server. These tools are essential for managing dependencies and running the script.

- PHP: [PHP Installation Guide](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)
- Composer: [Composer Getting Started](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine or server:

````bash
git clone https://your-repository-url-here
cd your-repository-directory

````

### Installing Dependencies

After cloning the repository, you need to install the required PHP dependencies, including the Google Client Library. Run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```bash
composer require google/apiclient:^2.0

````
If you are using an existing `composer.lock` file to install specific versions of the dependencies that have been tested with your project (like the one this repo has) , you should run:

```bash
composer install
```

This command will install the dependencies as specified in the `composer.lock` file, ensuring consistency across all environments.

If at any point you need to update your dependencies to their latest versions (and update the `composer.lock` file accordingly), you can run:

```bash
composer update
```

Remember, it's important to commit your `composer.lock` file to your version control system to ensure that all team members and deployment environments use the same dependency versions.
```

### Configuring Google Client

To use Google services, you must create a project in the Google Developers Console, enable the APIs you intend to use, and obtain authentication credentials.

1. Visit the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to the "Credentials" page and create credentials appropriate for your project (e.g., OAuth 2.0 Client IDs).
4. Enable the APIs you need by visiting the "Library" page and searching for the required services (e.g., Google Sheets API, Google Drive API).


### API Scopes

Ensure you include the correct scopes in your authentication flow. Scopes determine the level of access your application has to a user's data. Refer to the [Google Identity Platform documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) for a list of available scopes.

### Usage

Include documentation on how to use the script, highlighting any specific commands or endpoints relevant to the Google services integrated.

### Compatibility

This script is developed within a PrestaShop server environment but is designed to be compatible with various PHP environments, including WordPress and other content management systems or custom PHP applications.

### Additional Information

Feel free to include any additional information or sections that might be helpful, such as troubleshooting tips, contribution guidelines, or license information.
